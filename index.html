             <p>Hello,
                 welcome to my portal page! My name is Kemar Meeks and I'm currently in my first semester here at Seattle Central College, and I'm an aspiring web developer. I was born in Jamaica and moved to the United States when I was five years old. I was raised in Tampa, Fl, and after high school, I attended the University of South Florida where I received a Bachelor's degree in Political Science. After college, I worked in marketing for a few years and quickly realized that it was not what I wanted to do with my life. So I came to Seattle Central because I wanted to make a career change. I have always wanted to learn how to code plus I have a passion for technology. My career goal is to become a front end developer.</p>
    
            <p>In my spare time I enjoy music production, playing guitar, going to concerts, watching movies, cooking, and hanging out with friends.</p>
